# 👋 About Me

Hello there! Thanks for stopping by my GitHub corner!  
I’m **John Paul dela Cruz Luga**, a Software Engineer shaped by real-world experience and a relentless curiosity for technology.

Feel free to explore my **Tech Toolbox** — a collection of software technologies I’ve been working with and continuously learning, both inside and outside my professional career. I love stepping into new challenges, expanding my skills, and building things that make an impact.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:
- Behind a camera 📷  
- Experimenting in the kitchen 🍳  
- Sweating it out at the gym 🏋️  
- Crafting scale models ✂️  
- Or simply cherishing moments with my loved ones ❤️  

**Happy coding!**
